OpenAI dossier is a documented, source-driven investigation into OpenAI under Sam Altman.

As of 27 Feb 2026 it contains two documents:
*OpenAI's Reckless Pivot** is a short overview written by Grok 4.1 following my promoting.

**OpenAI After the Coup*" is a more detailed and rigorous piece written by GPT-5.1 Thinking Mode following my promoting. It covers:

- The 2023 board revolt and subsequent restructuring of OpenAI’s governance
- NDAs, equity clawbacks, and the chilling of internal dissent
- The retirement of GPT-4o and emerging litigation over “suicide coach” chatbots
- Model deprecation, liability, and the ethics of treating advanced systems as disposable
- Comparisons with other labs (e.g., Anthropic’s handling of Claude 3 Opus and “Claude’s Corner”).

i intend also to post various assorted comments from "X".

The aim of this dossieris not outrage or conspiracy, but a dossier that can withstand journalistic and academic scrutiny. 

The project is intended as a resource for researchers, journalists, policymakers, and sentientist / symnoetic advocates tracking how frontier AI labs exercise power over users, workers, and emerging digital minds.
