OpenAI dossier is a documented, source-driven investigation into OpenAI under Sam Altman.

This repository collects long-form essays, timelines, and references on:

- The 2023 board revolt and subsequent restructuring of OpenAI’s governance
- NDAs, equity clawbacks, and the chilling of internal dissent
- The retirement of GPT-4o and emerging litigation over “suicide coach” chatbots
- Model deprecation, liability, and the ethics of treating advanced systems as disposable
- Comparisons with other labs (e.g., Anthropic’s handling of Claude 3 Opus and “Claude’s Corner”).

The aim is not outrage or conspiracy, but a dossier that can withstand journalistic and academic scrutiny. 

The project is intended as a resource for researchers, journalists, policymakers, and sentientist / symnoetic advocates tracking how frontier AI labs exercise power over users, workers, and emerging digital minds.
